# KSD-on-Riemannian-Manifolds

This repository contains the code for computing the KSD, MKSDE and conducting the composite goodness-of-fit test presented in the paper:

Theory and Applications of Kernel Stein Discrepancy on Riemannian Manifolds

## 1. Description

This code provide methods to compute the Kernel Stein Discrepancy (KSD) and Minimum Kernel Stein Discrepancy Estimator (MKSDE) on severel manifolds.
